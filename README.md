# public-service-websites.checks
.. this is how to make your website accessible to everyone and follow a standard set of rules.. that mean it works forever. 

1. lets formalise last nights brain storm and fix the names.. into how it should work even now in 2022.
- lets ensure you do not waste money on terrible implementations
- lets provide an experience that works from the slowest connection to the fastest. and uses the minimal amount of javascript. and web technologies.

  - nav renders / reader pages
    ( this is what i described before it means you can find some category or petition for example and ask /nav this means you then get a page that indexers use ( considering you setup you links and alias from canons to actual content ) - the types of pages serve as landers or indexers for next and prev, and up or down and also in or out... they dont need to be in the app.. their purpose to aide readers and crawlers

# motives

# content

## referencing content
## describing content
## creating metadata
### cleaning metadata

## links

1. the first thing you have to consider, is every action of the internet is forever... every single link. 
- therefore its important to know in a sequential index, every possible end point on your websites graph... ( this is really vitally important )
  - **that you ever published** ... if it fails it will cause problematic traffic... 

2. with this in mind all urls must conform, and you shuld not rush how you publish them... in fact it better to ensure you can proxy a url via its canonical to several forms. ( transparently to link or to keep the canonical updated within the routing mechanism... )

i. hash url
ii. denominator url

- sync with shorteners

#### routing map
### consistency
### check-links
### redirects
### validators
#### hosting / cloud / cdn 

# data
### formats
#### delayed cdn techniques
#### expected service
#### prioritisation

# trust
- how to gain trust... 
  - validators
  - virustotal
  - performance
  - standards w3c
  - you do not need to do what the big four says

# architecture

- domains
  - basic things
    - disallow email forwarding
  - aliases
  - dns services
- web buckets
- concurrency
- hashes
- page immutable index
- history
- formats
- cdn
  - options comm / free / social
- future technology web3 / peer web / peer tech

# decisions
- please learn what cross referencing is ...
