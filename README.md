# public-service-websites.checks
.. this is how to make your website accessible to everyone and follow a standard set of rules.. that mean it works forever. 

1. lets formalise last nights brain storm and fix the names.. into how it should work even now in 2022.
- lets ensure you do not waste money on terrible implementations
- lets provide an experience that works from the slowest connection to the fastest. and uses the minimal amount of javascript. and web technologies.

# organisation

## particular case studies

- charities
- simple business service
- petitions
- social interaction

### example use cases

### modifiers of website
- orientation
- global
- local
- regional
- trust
- archive
- structure
- mapping
- formats
- history
- syndication
- updates
- indexers
- social media
- free media
- open media
- data formats
- data types
- service types
- application types and maps - this concerns a scale from a basic static to some restful / graphql service
- monitoring and insight
- code feedback
- user feedback
- vip

### aims 

#### ratings
- noble, security, civil, and syndicators

#### usability
- global attributes
- global artefact
- hateoas
- micronav
- microdata
- static
  - nav renders / reader pages
    ( this is what i described before it means you can find some category or petition for example and ask /nav this means you then get a page that indexers use ( considering you setup you links and alias from canons to actual content ) - the types of pages serve as landers or indexers for next and prev, and up or down and also in or out... they dont need to be in the app.. their purpose to aide readers and crawlers

- a1lly
- pa111ly
- data sharing
- data description
- historical, posterity, duty, validation
- security
- scaling
- global | local
- feedback / insight and problems

## semantic aspirations
- none of what we have is particularly good...most of the web is bad...

## versioning and ..
- over versions
- under versions
- the need for versions
### data requires a clear taxonomy and organisation
- confusing people wastes countless hours in emails and requests - if you insist on providing API, then please, reorganise it via aliases, into something that actually makes sense : over the duration of the service.. and don't mothball stuff that is badly understood...
- if your cloud/service/node serves, it must be documented and it must be within a tree....

# motives
- ,,

# content

## referencing content
## describing content
## creating metadata
### cleaning metadata

## links

1. the first thing you have to consider, is every action of the internet is forever... every single link. 
- therefore its important to know in a sequential index, every possible end point on your websites graph... ( this is really vitally important )
  - **that you ever published** ... if it fails it will cause problematic traffic... 

2. with this in mind all urls must conform, and you shuld not rush how you publish them... in fact it better to ensure you can proxy a url via its canonical to several forms. ( transparently to link or to keep the canonical updated within the routing mechanism... )

3. so long as this exists in various sitemaps ( which should be compressed ) it will work... 

a. if you change it dont forget what existed before this is the biggest mistake I see.. in fact this is what the `url-immutable-index` is... 

i. hash url
ii. denominator url

- sync with shorteners

#### routing map
### consistency
### check-links
### redirects
### validators
#### hosting / cloud / cdn 

# data
### formats
#### delayed cdn techniques
#### expected service
#### prioritisation

# trust
- how to gain trust... 
  - validators
  - virustotal
  - performance
  - standards w3c
  - security
  - sessions
  - certificates
  - references
  - key people
  - data retention
  - clear data policy
  - ethics
  - slave statement
  - carbon neutrality
  - mission statement
  - simple staff description
  - advert syndication and implementation
  - advert policy
  - funding statement
  - advert reason document
  - board mission statement
  - board composition
### do not present too much information
#### do not give away personal details - just enough for people to know what this is actually about 
- and you have nothing to hide.. 

# architecture

- domains
  - basic things
    - disallow email forwarding

- cdn
  - options comm / free / social

### base & iterations
### bottlenecks and architecture in the wrong hands... 
### being bold and making a statement
#### being aware of needs of all people
## kanban really works 
### being honest
#### people will like being told the truth
## gradual implementation from a solid foundation

# maps
## formal types
- linkmap
- sitemaps
  - advanced sitemaps
- datamaps
- resourcemaps
### descriptor types
#### xml
#### json
#### application/service
#### enhancers

## map --> graph --> rest / graphql / static / format
### graph edges
### nodes

## static descriptor
## dynamic descriptor

## tags
- over tags
- under tags
- using tags to reference the websites graph, map, and age
### local
